# Agricultural-Automation-System With Kivy based Android App
I was involved in a Agricultural Irrigation Automation System design, development, and deployment project for a Startup. Initially, I developed a mobile application for showing all the measured data and provide GUI for a user to  control operation of his irrigation facility. It was just a study project for initial  phase  of system  development and design so I am providing here the details of my project. My Arduino program running in ESP8266 and my python kivy code. You can also read my documentations for this project and it might get helpful for you if you are also doing similar project.  Please  feel free to connect with me if you have any queries. 
The Python kivy code and Arduino Codes uploaded to ESP8266 are available in main.py and my.kv. Arduino program file, named fully_manual.ino is also provided here.
The python codes include all the source code of the developed mobile application. And it was lauched using google colab to convert my kivy app to .apk file format which is also provided in this thread.
