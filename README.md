# Agricultural-Automation-System
I was involved in a Agricultural Irrigation Automation System design, development, and deployment project for a Startup. Initially, I developed a mobile application for showing all the measured data and provide GUI for a user to  control operation of his irrigation facility. It was just a study project for initial  phase  of system  development and design so I am providing here the details of my project. My Arduino program running in ESP8266 and my python kivy code. You can also read my documentations for this project and it might get helpful for you if you are also doing similar project.  Please  feel free to connect with me if you have any queries.
